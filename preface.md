# 前言
<p class="en">Back in 1998 when I was eight years old, I picked up my first book on computing—on JavaScript and HTML. Little did I know that opening that book would transform my life by exposing me to programming languages and the amazing things I could do with them. I was hooked. Every so often, I still find a new programming language feature that revives this excitement because it enables me to write clearer, more concise code in half the time. I hope that the new ideas in Java 8, Java 9, and Java 10, incorporated from functional programming and explored in this book, inspire you in the same way.</p>

回到1998年当时我8岁, 我拿起了我的第一本计算机书-关于JavaScript和HTML的书. 小小的我就意识到打开这本书将把我的人生引向令人吃惊的编程语言的世界. 我被深深的迷住了. 经常的, 我会为发现的新的语言特性感到兴奋, 因为使我可以编写干净的, 简洁的代码并节省一半时间. 我希望本书介绍的Java 8, Java 9和Java 10从函数式编程引入的新概念, 能够启发你以这样的方式编程.

<p class="en">So, you may wonder, how did this book—and its second edition—come about?</p>

所以, 你可能想知道, 这本书和新的第二版带来了什么?

<p class="en">Well, back in 2011, Brian Goetz (the Java Language Architect at Oracle) was sharing various proposals to add lambda expressions to Java, with the aim of getting the community involved. These rekindled my excitement, and I started to evangelize the ideas, organizing Java 8 workshops at various developer conferences and giving lectures to students at the University of Cambridge.</p>

好吧, 回到2011年, Brian Goetz (Oracle Java架构师)为了增加社区的参与度, 分享了为Java添加lambda表达式多个提议. 这些提议重燃了我的兴趣, 所以我开始提炼这些想法, 并在多个开发者大会上组织Java 8的研讨会和给剑桥大学的学生做演讲.

<p class="en">By April 2013, word had spread, and our publisher at Manning emailed asking whether I was interested in writing a book about lambdas in Java 8. At the time I was a “humble” second-year PhD candidate, and that seemed to be a bad idea because it would interfere with my thesis submission schedule. On the other hand, carpe diem. I thought writing a short book shouldn’t be too much work, right? (It was only later that I realized I was utterly wrong!) So, I sought advice from my PhD supervisor, Professor Alan Mycroft, who, it turned out, was ready to support me in this adventure (even offering to help in such non-PhD work—I’m forever in his debt). A few days later, we met fellow Java 8 evangelist Mario Fusco, who had vast professional experience and had become well known at major developer conferences for his talks on functional programming.</p>

直到2013年4月, 编写工作开始铺开, Manning出版商邮件咨询我是否对出版一本关于Java 8的lambda的书感兴趣. 当时我还是一个默默无闻的博士二年级的候选人. 这看起来是一个坏主意, 因为会干扰我的毕业论文呈递计划. 另一方面, **(拉丁语: 及时行乐)**, 我想编写一本"薄书"应该不会有太多工作量, 对吧? (只是后来我才意识到我大错特错了!) 所以, 我寻求了我的博士生导师的意见, Alan Mycroft教授, 结果他早已准备好支持我的这段奇幻之旅(即使没有对这些非博士论文工作的支持-我也会永远感激). 之后过了些天, 我们遇到了同伴Java 8传道者Mario Fusco, 他有全面的专业经验, 并且因为他的函数式编程的演讲已经被各大主要的开发者大会熟知.

<p class="en">We quickly realized that by combining our energy and diverse backgrounds we could deliver, not just a short book on Java 8 lambdas, but instead a book that, we hope, the Java community will still be reading in five or ten years. We had a unique opportunity to discuss many topics in depth that will benefit Java programmers and open doors to a new universe of ideas: functional programming.</p>

我们很快意识到结合我们的活力和不同的背景我们将可以投递一个不仅仅只是Java 8的lambda表达式的薄书. 我们期望我们的书, 在Java社区五年甚至十年仍然被阅读. 我们拥有独一无二的机会来深入讨论许多将使Java开发者受益的主题和打开通向函数式编程世界的大门.

<p class="en">Now, it’s 2018, and we find that the first edition amazingly sold 20,000 copies, Java 9 has just been released, Java 10 is about to be released, and time has dulled the memory of many long nights of editing. So, here it is—the second edition Modern Java in Action, covering Java 8, Java 9, and Java 10. We hope you will enjoy it!</p>

现在是2018年, 我们发现第一版惊奇的售卖了20000份, Java 9也刚刚正式发布了, Java 10也准备发布了, 在经历过无数个无聊的编写书籍的夜晚. 所以, 现在呈现的是第二版的Modern Java in Action, 覆盖了Java 8, Java 9, and Java 10. 期望你能喜欢它!
